# Project Grading Guide

Your project will evolve through three phases. Each phase builds on the previous one, but you can move at your project's natural pace within these guidelines.

## Grading Breakdown
Each phase is graded on five components:
- Report (20%): Problem statement, methodology, results
- Implementation (35%): Working code, tests, experiments
- Development Process (15%): Logs, decisions, iterations
- Critiques (15%): Reflection and planning
  - Self-critiques (required)
  - Peer critiques (when assigned)
  - Response to feedback
- Repository Structure (15%): Organization, documentation, clarity

## Phase 1: Make It Work (Weeks 3-7)
Focus on getting a basic version running and validating your approach.

**Core Requirements**
- Working code that runs end-to-end
- Clear problem statement
- Initial results
- Basic documentation
- Development log started
- Self-critiques

All project files should be in their proper places:
```
your-repo/
├── report.md              # Your current draft
├── notebooks/            # Your experiments
├── src/                 # Your clean code
├── docs/
│   ├── critiques/      # Your self-critiques
│   └── dev_log.md      # Development notes
```

## Phase 2: Make It Better (Weeks 8-11)
Focus on improving your solution and validating results.

**Core Requirements**
- Solid mathematical foundation
- Good test coverage
- Clear experimental results
- Regular documentation updates
- Continued development log
- Self-critiques

## Phase 3: Make It Complete (Weeks 12-14)
Focus on polishing and presenting your work.

**Core Requirements**
- Complete analysis
- Clean, documented code
- Clear presentation of results
- Final report
- Full development history
- Final self-critique

## Weekly Cycle
1. Try something
2. Document what happened
3. Plan next step
4. Repeat

## Repository Requirements
Maintain these throughout:
- Code in proper directories
- Updated documentation
- Development log entries
- Self-critiques
- Clear README

Remember:
- Quality > Quantity
- Working > Perfect
- Clear > Clever

These are minimum requirements. Strong projects will go beyond these basics in areas that matter most for their specific goals.
