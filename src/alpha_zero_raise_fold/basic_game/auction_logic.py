    Project Description:

    My project idea focuses on solving a dynamic decision-making problem in the context of a simplified fantasy hockey auction. The setup for the auction is as follows:

    League Structure: The league consists of 8 members, each provided with 1000 tokens to spend in an auction.

    Team Composition: Each member must build a team of 20 players: 12 forwards, 6 defensemen, and 2 goalies.

    Player Valuation: For simplicity's sake each playerâ€™s value is represented as independent random variables with a known mean and variance - all members agree upon these distributions. These values are realized after the auction is completed.

    Auction Mechanics:

    Players are randomly nominated for auction each round.

    The bidding proceeds cyclically, where each member decides whether to bid up or pass.

    Bidding up increases the current price by one token and temporarily assigns the player to the bidder.

    If a member passes, they are no longer allowed to bid on the player for that round.

    The auction ends for a player when only one member remains in the bidding, and the player is awarded to them for the final price.

    Objective: My overarching goal is to maximize E(rank), determined by the cumulative realized value of the drafted players compared to other members. This creates a complex strategic environment where decisions need to account for budget constraints, remaining roster spots, and the uncertainty in player valuations.
        
    Below we define the environment class for the auction game. The environment is responsible for managing the game state, executing actions, and providing feedback to the agents.
